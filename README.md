# BikeSystem
## Overview
Piece of coursework for the Introduction to Software Engineering Course (2019-20) at UoE. The task was to develop and design software for a federalised bike rental system. The actual implementation was part 3 of the coursework and only required a fraction of the functionality of the whole system to be implemented.
